Enables creation of data grid applications in AngularJS.

Handsontable is a composite spreadsheet component for apps and websites. It is written in JavaScript and not 
constrained by any external framework. It can be easily modified or extended with custom plugins. It also binds to any 
source using the JSON format and handles large amounts of data. You can easily do all CRUD operations and provide 
end-users with an Excel-like experience.
