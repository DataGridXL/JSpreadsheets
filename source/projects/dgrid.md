dgrid is a next-generation grid component that takes full advantage of modern browsers and object stores. Lightweight, 
modular, and easily extensible, dgrid is released under the same open-source license and CLA as the Dojo Toolkit.

* Modern Architecture - dgrid has been designed to take advantage of AMD with granular dependencies; this means it only loads the bare essentials.
* Mixins - Use declare to create a custom constructor to add features such as in-cell editing and row or cell selection.
* Extensions - Resizable columns, column reordering, pagination and more are achieved through dgrid extensions. Or easily create your own extensions to meet your specific needs.
* Skinning - dgrid ships with several default themes including the Claro theme to match the popular Dijit theme. You can easily customize dgrid through well documented CSS and/or jQuery ThemeRoller classes.
* Mobile Support - dgrid has been tested to work on iOS and Android browsers, providing efficient rendering for your data on the go.
* A11y - The Keyboard mixin adds keyboard handling functionality. The arrow keys can be used to navigate the focus across cells and rows, providing accessibility and ease of use.
