ReactPivot is a data-grid component with pivot-table-like functionality for data display, filtering, and exploration. Can be used without React.

ReactPivot takes four arguments: `rows`, `dimensions`, `reduce` and `calculations`. Where:

* `rows` is your data, just an array of objects,
* `dimensions` is how you want to group your data,
* `reduce` is how you calculate numbers for each group,
* `calculations` is how you want to display the calculations done in `reduce`

#### Preview:

##### Filter data
