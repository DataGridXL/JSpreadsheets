The w2ui library is a set jQuery plugins for front-end development of data driven web applications. It contains all most common UI widgets: Layout, Grid, Sidebar, Tabs, Toolbar, Popup, Field Controls and Forms. You do not need to put together a collection of mismatched plugins to accomplish your goals.

* Lightweight. Very small foot print, only 69Kb.
* Feature rich out of the box. Resizable columns, reordering, infinite scroll, frozen columns, you name it.
* Skinning - Create you own scheme by changing colors in LESS file, and it will propagate through out.
