This is a spreadsheet component built in Facebook's ReactJS.

The component is initialized with a configuration object. If desired, initial data for the spreadsheet can be passed in 
as an array of rows. In addition, you can pass in a second array filled with class names for each cell, allowing you 
to style each cell differently.
