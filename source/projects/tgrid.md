description: HTML5 ready fully functional grid with Knockout.JS and AngularJS support.
---

TypeScript, AngularJS and Knockout compatible, fully customizable grid with rich functionality.

This plugin was created when i was upgrading a small framework of mine and i needed a table to present the records. 
It was then when i first heard about jQuery library and began to study it. Then i have seen tablesorter plugin and 
thought it was exact thing that i needed to my project. I needed to add some functionality to it, though. Firstly, 
i noticed that when i filled tablesorter with a big ammount of data and turned 'pagination' option on, my browsers 
[firefox and opera] just went nuts when it came to memory usage. So i thought i could add my own method of pagination. 
Then, i wanted to add some filtering and thirdly, i needed to combine it with the models of my framework 
(so that the tablesorter would sort of "create" the sql queries for me. I think i have succeded :)

#### Preview:
